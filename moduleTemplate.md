This is a template for a #rrhack module.

The [rr-intro](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-intro) repository is a good example module.

All repositories should contain the following files:

* LICENSE.md : CC0
* README.md : a description of the lesson, including collaborators, synposis, syllabus ("after this lesson, students should be able to..."), any setup instructions, and a summary of other files in the repo

##Notes
(not completely formed thoughts that should be added to a final template)

* slides: suggestions for format, file naming, length of lecture / proportion of module that should be lecture vs activity
* instructor notes: detailed description of the lesson, including timing, activities, gotchas, etc
* file naming: moduleshortname-##-slug.extension where:
  * `moduleshortname` is a unique short name that identifies the modeule (e.g. intro, organization, etc). Helpful, for example, when we copy the slides from each module into the workshop website repo so that everything isn't just called "slides"
  * `##` is the submodule number (01, 02, etc) for lessons divided into submodules (a submodule might be slides + exercise + discussion)
  * `slug` is the description of that file (e.g. instr-notes, slides, etc)
* instructions for exercises should be either written into the slides for presentation to students, or provided int the instructors notes for pasting into the etherpad
